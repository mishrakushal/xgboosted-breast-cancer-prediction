# Modified Breast Cancer Prediction Model
This is a modified implementation of the breast cancer prediction model which now uses the XGBoost library for more accurate predictions.

## About this model:
- The new version of the model uses an ``XGB classifier``.
- After the applied changes, the model now makes predictions accurately up to ``98.6%``, with the new mean accuracy being ``96.53%`` and a standard deviation of ``2.07%``.
- The new mean accuracy was calculated using ``10-fold`` cross validation.
